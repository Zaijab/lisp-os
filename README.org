* LISP-OS

A simple Scheme-like Lisp interpreter that can also be run as a simple self-contained operating system.

** Includes
   Scheme-like semantics

   Move and Copy garbage collector

   User space

   Lisp Macro System

   First class data types: (signed fixed precision) integer, double, arrays, hash tables, symbols, strings, procedures and closures (lambda expressions).


* Usage

  OS Starts into a REPL. (quit) exits

  Write procesures using (define (proc args...) body). Note that this is equivalent to (define proc (lambda (args...) body))

  Define macros using (defmacro (mac args...) body)

  Use (toplevel) to inspect toplevel defined symbols

  Memory management is split into the heap, that manages all dynamic objects (cons cells, strings etc)
